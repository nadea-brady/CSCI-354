        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            Monster Hunter World presents a unique challenge to players who must gather information about monsters, 
            resources, and gear. Currently, the information is scattered across various websites, and it’s difficult for 
            players to keep track of everything they need to optimize their hunts. Existing websites, while helpful, are 
            not interactive enough and do not provide tailored suggestions based on the player’s current gear and 
            upcoming monster.
        </p>
        <p>
            A web app that consolidates this information and provides real-time recommendations for players based 
            on their loadouts and the monsters they are hunting will streamline the preparation process, improving 
            gameplay efficiency and player satisfaction.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            The proposed web application is designed to help Monster Hunter World players optimize their gear and 
            plan hunts more effectively. Users will select a monster they wish to hunt, and the app will provide information 
            on the monster’s weaknesses and suggest ideal equipment based on the player's current gear setup.
        </p>
        <p>
            Players can input their current weapon, armor, and items, and the app will generate suggestions for optimal 
            loadouts, taking into account the selected monster’s attributes. This feature will save time by eliminating 
            the need to consult multiple external resources. In addition, users will have access to helpful tips, drop rates, 
            and crafting materials needed for future hunts.
        </p>

        <h2>Data and Images</h2>
        <p>
            The web application will require data on monster attributes, including weaknesses, resistances, and drop rates. This data will be stored in a database and retrieved as users make their selections. Additional data, such as weapon stats and crafting materials, will also be available.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app will feature images of monsters, weapons, and gear to visually engage users. These images will be sourced from external resources such as:
